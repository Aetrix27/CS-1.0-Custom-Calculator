# homework_1_custom_calculator
This calculator program is my first program, and will calculate a result by using a function that takes input parameters, and returns a string with the appropriate output.

IMPORTANT: The user MUST enter a three numbers (trinomial) that makes it so the square root is positive, examples are displayed when starting the program.

This program gathers input from the user by asking them to input three coefficients, which
will input into the quadratic equation to find a positive and negative root solution. These roots are often used to find the solutions of a parabola graph.
